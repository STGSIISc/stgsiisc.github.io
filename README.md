Hi, I am Sumanta, a student of the IISc Mathematics Department interested in topology. I designed/developed our non-commercial, non-profitable website https://stgsiisc.github.io/. Also, I am currently maintaining this website. You can mail me at <a href="mailto:sumantad030@gmail.com">sumantad030@gmail.com</a> <br/> <br/>




I want to thank Ajay Nair, Kartick Ghosh, Sivaram P., and Gobinda Sau for their constant support in making this website. The exact purpose of it is to record details of different talks given by a group of mathematics students interested in topology and geometry, nothing more than that. For more details about the website, see this page https://stgsiisc.github.io/website.html
