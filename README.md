Hi, I am Sumanta, a student of the IISc Mathematics Department interested in topology. I designed/developed our non-commercial, non-profitable website https://stgsiisc.github.io/. I want to thank Ajay Nair, Kartick Ghosh, Gobinda Sau, and Sivaram P. for their constant support in making this website.. The exact purpose of it is to record details of different talks given by a group of mathematics students interested in topology and geometry, nothing more than that. For more details about the website, see this page https://stgsiisc.github.io/website.html
